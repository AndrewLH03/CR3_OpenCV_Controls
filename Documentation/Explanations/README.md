# Documentation Explanations Index

This folder contains beginner-friendly explanations of the CR3 Hand Tracking Control System, written for someone with no prior ROS2 or robotics knowledge.

## üìö Available Explanations

### üéØ [Current System Explained](Current_System_Explained.md)
**Complete beginner's guide to your robot system**
- What ROS2 is and how it works (restaurant analogy)
- Your project structure and file organization
- How nodes, topics, services, and parameters work
- Current implementation status and next steps
- Testing and visualization instructions

### üîç [ROS2 Visualization Guide](ROS2_Visualization_Guide.md)
**Understanding what you see in rqt_graph and other tools**
- Why you see single nodes with no connections
- How to make connections visible
- rqt_graph display options and settings
- Command line alternatives for system inspection
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- Expected evolution as development progresses

## üéì Learning Path

**If you're completely new to ROS2:**
1. Start with [Current System Explained](Current_System_Explained.md)
2. Follow the testing examples to see your system in action
3. Use [ROS2 Visualization Guide](ROS2_Visualization_Guide.md) to understand what you're seeing

**If you want to understand specific aspects:**
- **System architecture**: See "The Restaurant Analogy" in Current System Explained
- **File organization**: See "Your Project Structure Explained" section
- **Communication patterns**: See "How Everything Communicates" section
- **Troubleshooting visualization**: Use the ROS2 Visualization Guide

## üîó Related Documentation

- **Implementation Plans**: [`../Phases/`](../Phases/) - Step-by-step development guides
- **Technical Details**: [`../`](../) - Technical documentation and architecture
- **Historical Progress**: [`../History/`](../History/) - Development timeline and decisions

## üí° Quick Start Testing

To immediately see your system in action:

```bash
# Build and run your system
cd /home/andrewlh/CR3_OpenCV_Controls/ros2_package
colcon build
source install/setup.bash

# Terminal 1: Start robot controller
ros2 run cr3_hand_control basic_robot_controller

# Terminal 2: Visualize system
ros2 run rqt_graph rqt_graph

# Terminal 3: Inspect system
ros2 node list
ros2 topic list
```

This will show you the current state of your Phase 2 implementation with basic ROS2 infrastructure running.
