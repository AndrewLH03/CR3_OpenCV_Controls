## 📁 Current File Organization

### Domain-Based Structure:
```
src/                 # C++ source organized by domain
scripts/             # Python scripts by domain  
config/              # Configuration files by domain
launch/              # Launch files by scope (systems/subsystems/testing)
test/                # Tests by scope (unit/integration/shared)
msg/                 # Messages organized by domain
srv/                 # Services organized by domain
```
