# Phase 3: Workspace Safety and Coordinate Systems
**Duration**: 2 days  
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive safety systems and establish coordinate system transformations

## Tasks

### 1. Safety System Implementation
- Workspace boundary definitions
- Collision detection algorithms
- Emergency stop protocols
- Speed limiting based on proximity

### 2. Coordinate System Management
- Camera frame to robot base transformation
- Calibration procedures
- Dynamic coordinate updates
- Transformation validation

### 3. Safety Testing Suite
- Boundary violation tests
- Emergency stop response time tests
- Coordinate transformation accuracy tests

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Robot stops when approaching workspace boundaries
- ✅ Emergency stop activates within 100ms
- ✅ Coordinate transformations accurate to ±2mm
- ✅ All safety systems independently testable

## Deliverables
- Complete safety system
- Coordinate transformation library
- Safety testing framework

## Previous Phase
