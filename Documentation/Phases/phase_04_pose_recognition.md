# Phase 4: Pose Recognition Foundation (OpenCV + MediaPipe)
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Goal**: Implement reliable pose recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe with ROS2 integration

> **Note**: This phase leverages the working implementation from `Dashboards/hand_tracking/` which contains a proven pose recognition system with shoulder and wrist tracking.

## Tasks

### 1. MediaPipe Integration (Pose + Hand Detection)
- **Pose Detection**: Full body pose estimation with shoulder tracking
- **Hand Detection**: Precise hand landmark extraction with wrist tracking
- **Multi-tracking**: Simultaneous pose and hand detection for better accuracy
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Robust detection filtering
- **Performance Optimization**: 30+ FPS real-time processing

### 2. OpenCV Camera Interface
- Camera initialization and configuration
- Frame capture and processing pipeline
- Image enhancement and visualization overlays
- Error handling and recovery
- Debug visualization with coordinate display

### 3. ROS2 Pose Recognition Node
- `src/pose_recognition_node.py` (renamed from hand_tracking_node.py)
- Real-time shoulder and wrist coordinate publishing
- Debug image streaming with pose overlays
- Performance monitoring and health checks
- Robot control integration interface

### 4. Custom Message Definitions
- `msg/PoseCoordinates.msg` (shoulder + wrist positions)
- `msg/PoseTrackingStatus.msg` (detection confidence and status)
- `msg/DebugInfo.msg` (performance metrics and debug data)

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Consistent pose detection at 30+ FPS
- ✅ Accurate shoulder and wrist tracking (±5 pixels)
- ✅ Smooth coordinate output (minimal jitter)
- ✅ Robust performance in varying lighting
- ✅ Debug visualization working

## Deliverables
- Complete pose recognition node
- OpenCV/MediaPipe integration
- Custom ROS2 messages
- Debug visualization system
