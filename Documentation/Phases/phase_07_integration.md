# Phase 7: System Integration and Testing
**Duration**: 4-5 days  
**Goal**: Integrate all components into a cohesive system with comprehensive testing

## Tasks

### 1. Complete System Integration
- Launch file creation and configuration
- Inter-node communication verification
- End-to-end data flow testing
- System startup and shutdown procedures

### 2. Launch File Development
- `launch/cr3_complete_system.launch.py`
- `launch/hand_tracking_only.launch.py`
- `launch/robot_control_only.launch.py`
- `launch/testing_mode.launch.py`

### 3. Integration Testing Suite
- Component interaction tests
- Data flow validation tests
- Performance regression tests
- Failure mode analysis

### 4. System Configuration
- Parameter file optimization
- QoS profile fine-tuning
- Resource allocation optimization
- Error recovery procedures

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All components integrate seamlessly
- ✅ Launch files start system reliably
- ✅ No component conflicts or resource issues
- ✅ Integration tests pass consistently
- ✅ System recovery from all failure modes

## Deliverables
- Complete integrated system
- Launch file configuration
- Integration testing framework
- System configuration guides
